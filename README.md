# Hashtable in c

*Use at your own risk*

Hashtable able to store variables and structs. Tested against ints and structs with char[], int, float.

Uses [linear probing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_probing) to avoid collisions. If the hashtable is full it will print an error message and return.
